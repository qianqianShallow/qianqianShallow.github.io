I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), advised by [Prof. Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree from the School of Software Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University.

My research interests lie in **Explainable artificial intelligence**, with a particular focus on understanding the decision-making logic behind neural network outputs. I believe that developing reliable explanations for neural networks can open up these “black-box” models and accelerate the deployment and development of trustworthy AI. In addition, I am very interested in exploring the cutting-edge technologies of artificial intelligence.
